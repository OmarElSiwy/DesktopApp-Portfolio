## Project Motivation
I plan to hone my c++ skills for future development experiences through using the qt library and learning correct design patterns. Also to use it as my portfolio project :P

# Project Description
I include a brief description and ICS4U cirriculum expectations about me in a modern/sleek gui application using C++ qt libraries.

# Dependencies
* C++ 17 or Later
* QT 6.0 Build Tools or Later

# How to Install
`git clone https://github.com/OmarElSiwy/DesktopApp-Portfolio.git`
From there it should be ready for usage in visual studio
For other IDEs, alter the cmake file based on IDE recommendations

# How to Package
Should be found online, dont be lazy, unlike me who is being lazy by not writing it down
